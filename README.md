### Problem Statement
**1. Python Skill [20 poin]**
- Create a Python program that can:
    - Retrieve data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or others).
    - Save the data into a JSON file.
    - Perform simple analysis, such as calculating the average temperature from the retrieved data for the last 7 days.
- Evaluation Criteria:
    - API integration capability.
    - Accuracy of the analysis calculation.
    - Clean and well-documented code.  


**2. PyTorch Skill [25 poin]**
- Build a simple neural network model using PyTorch for image classification with the Stanford Dogs dataset (available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset).

- Evaluation Criteria:
    - Appropriate model structure.
    - Model accuracy.
    - Clean and modular code.


**3. Model Serving Skill [30 poin]**
- Deploy the image classification model built in Task 2 using FastAPI. Ensure the endpoint includes the following features
   - An endpoint to receive an image and return a predicted label.
   - Automatic documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
   - A Dockerfile to run the application in a containerized environment.

- Evaluation Criteria:
    - The endpoint functions correctly.
    - The Dockerfile successfully runs the application.
    - Clean and well-documented code.


**4. Data Analytics Skill [20 poin]**
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the "Titanic" dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to answer the following questions:
    - What proportion of passengers survived?
    - Is there a correlation between the "Age" and "Fare" features?
    - How is the distribution of passengers based on class and gender?
    - The EDA results should be visualized using matplotlib or seaborn.
- Evaluation Criteria:
    - Comprehensive analysis.
    - Informative visualizations.
    - Documentation of the analysis steps.


**5. Feature Engineering Skill [25 poin]**
- Given the "House Prices" dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), create a Python script to perform the following tasks:
    - Impute missing values.
    - Encode categorical features.
    - Normalize numerical features.
    - Create relevant new features (e.g., the ratio of house area to the number of rooms).

- Evaluation Criteria:
    - Implementation of feature engineering techniques.
    - Quality of the newly created features.
    - Clean and well-documented code.
